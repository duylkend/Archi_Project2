In the reduced budget scenario, I would consider decreasing the type of EC2 instances to reduce costs. By opting for lower-cost instance types, such as c5a.4xlarge or c5a.2xlarge, we can achieve significant savings while still meeting the required functionality. This change allows us to allocate more of the budget to other critical components of the infrastructure, ensuring cost efficiency without compromising performance.
