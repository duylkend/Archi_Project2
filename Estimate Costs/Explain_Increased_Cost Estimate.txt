To improve performance and scalability of the system, we upgraded the EC2 instances from c5a.12xlarge to c5a.24xlarge, enhancing processing power and memory capacity. Additionally, we expanded the size of DynamoDB from data storage size 5 TB to 10 and average item size of all attributes from 5 to 20KB TB to ensure the database can handle larger query and write volumes without experiencing bottlenecks. These changes will enable smoother system operation and better meet user demands in high-load situations
